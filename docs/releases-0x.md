- Enhanced the cStor Volume Provisioning to be customized for varying workload or platform type during the volume provisioning.
- Enhanced the cStor Pools to export usage statistics as prometheus metrics.
- Enhanced the Jiva Volume replica rebuild process by eliminating the need to do a rebuild if the Replica already has all the required data to serve the IO.
- Enhanced the Jiva Volume - replica provisioning to pin the Replicaâ€™s to the nodes where they are initially scheduled using Kubernetes nodeAffinity.
- Fixes an issue where NDM pods failed to start on nodes with selinux=on.
- Fixes an issue where cStor Volume with single replicas were shown to be in Degraded, rebuilding state.
- Fixes an issue where user was able to delete a PVC, even if there were clones created from it, resulting in data loss for the cloned volumes.
- Fixes an issue where cStor Volumes failed to provision if the `/var/openebs/` directory was not editable by cStor pods like in the case of SuSE Platforms.
- Fixes an issue where Jiva Volume - Target can mark a replica as offline if the replica takes longer than 30s to complete the sync/unmap IO.
- Fixes an issue with Jiva volume - space reclaim thread, that was erroring out with an exception if the replica is disconnected from the target.

- Fixed an issue causing cStor Volume Replica CRs to be stuck, when the OpenEBS namespace was being deleted.
- Fixed an issue where a newly added cStor Volume Replica may not be successfully registered with the cStor target, if the cStor tries to connect to Replica before the replica is completely initialised.
- Fixed an issue with Jiva Volumes where target can mark the Replica as Timed out on IO, even when the Replica might actually be processing the Sync IO.
- Fixed an issue with Jiva Volumes that would not allow for Replicas to re-connect with the Target, if the initial Registration failed to successfully process the hand-shake request.
- Fixed an issue with Jiva Volumes that would cause Target to restart when a send diagnostic command was received from the client
- Fixed an issue causing PVC to be stuck in pending state, when there were more than one PVCs associated with an Application Pod
- Toleration policy support for cStorStoragePool.
