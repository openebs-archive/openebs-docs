### Overview of OpenEBS Logger

Logger is a Kubernetes job which can be run on a cluster to extract pod logs and cluster information. It helps in troubleshooting/debugging activities. Logger runs the logger container *openebs/logger* and it is recommended to run for a specific duration to capture logs while attempting to reproduce issues.

### Benefits

Following are the benefits of using Logger.

- The purpose of Logger is to obtain debug-information/quick logs in clusters where more standard logging frameworks like EFK are not already configured. Logger creates a simple support bundle which can be provided to debug teams.
- This may be the case with most "non-production/development" infrastructures.

### Where is the Logger found?

You can find the Logger file [here](https://github.com/openebs/test-tools/blob/master/logger/debugjob.yamll).

### How does Logger work?

Logger uses the following tool/command to work.

- Logger uses a **stern** tool to collect the pod logs.
- It uses kubectl commands to extract cluster information.

### Prerequisite

Logger requires the *kubeconfig* file mounted as a configmap (passed to stern binary). *kubeconfig* file is generally found under */etc/kubernetes/admin.conf* or *~/.kube/config* path.

## Running Logger

The following procedure helps you run Logger.

1. In the logger job's command, edit the logging duration (-d) and pod regex (-r) to specify which pods' logs should be captured and for how long.

   For example, in the  `./logger.sh -d 5 -r maya,openebs,pvc;` command, the logs for pods starting with literals "maya", "openebs" and "pvc" are captured for a period of 5 minutes.

   **Note:** The duration is arrived depending on the average time taken for the issue/bug to manifest from the time a pod starts.

2. Create a Kubernetes job to run logger using the `kubectl apply -f debugjob.yaml` command.

3. This job will run for the duration specified in the previous steps.

4. The logs thus collected are placed in a logbundle (tarball) in */mnt* directory of the node in which the debug pod was scheduled.

5. Logs will be available in the node in which the debug pod/logger is scheduled when you run a `kubectl get pod -o wide` command.

6. Attach this log support bundle while raising issues on the OpenEBS repository.
