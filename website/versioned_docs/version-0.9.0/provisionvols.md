## Provision from a disk pool

<br>

Use a similar PVC spec or volumeClaimTemplate to use a StorageClass that is pointing to a pool with real disks. Consider the following parameters while provisioning OpenEBS volumes on real disks



**AccessModes:** cStor provides iSCSI targets, which are appropriate for RWO (ReadWriteOnce) access mode and is suitable for all types of databases. For webscale applications like WordPress or any for any other NFS needs, you need RWM (ReadWriteMany) access mode. For RWM, you need NFS provisioner to be deployed along with cStor. See <a href="/v090/docs/next/rwm.html" target="_blank">how to provision RWM PVC with OpenEBS </a>.

**Size:** cStor supports thin provisioning by default, which means you can request any size of the volume through the PVC and get it provisioned. Resize of the volume is not fully supported through the OpenEBS control plane in the current release (OpenEBS 0.9.0) and is active development, see [roadmap](/v090/docs/next/cstor.html#cstor-roadmap) for more details. Hence it is recommended to give good amount of buffer to the required size of the volume so that you don't need to resize immediately or in the very short time period. 

<font size="5">Example configuration for requesting OpenEBS volumes for a `deployment` </font>



```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: cstor-pvc-mysql-large
spec:
  storageClassName: openebs-cstor-pool1-3-replicas
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Gi
```



<font size="5">Example configuration for requesting OpenEBS volumes for a `StatefulSet`</font>



```
spec:
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: elasticdb-vol-openebs
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 500Gi
      storageClassName: openebs-cstor-pool1-1-replica
```

## Monitor volumes

By default the `VolumeMonitor` is set to ON in cStor StorageClasses. Volume metrics are exported when this parameter is set to ON. Following metrics are supported by cStor as of the current release.

```

openebs_actual_used # Actual volume size used
openebs_connection_error_total # Total no of connection errors
openebs_connection_retry_total # Total no of connection retry requests
openebs_degraded_replica_count # Total no of degraded/ro replicas
openebs_healthy_replica_count # Total no of healthy replicas
openebs_logical_size # Logical size of volume
openebs_parse_error_total # Total no of parsing errors
openebs_read_block_count # Read Block count of volume
openebs_read_time # Read time on volume
openebs_reads # Read Input/Outputs on Volume
openebs_sector_size # sector size of volume
openebs_size_of_volume # Size of the volume requested
openebs_total_read_bytes # Total read bytes
openebs_total_replica_count # Total no of replicas connected to cas
openebs_total_write_bytes # Total write bytes
openebs_volume_status # Status of volume: (1, 2, 3, 4) = {Offline, Degraded, Healthy, Unknown}
openebs_volume_uptime # Time since volume has registered
openebs_write_block_count # Write Block count of volume
openebs_write_time # Write time on volume
openebs_writes # Write Input/Outputs on Volume
```



Grafana charts can be built for the above Prometheus metrics. Some metrics OpenEBS volumes are available automatically at MayaOnline when you connect the Kubernetes cluster to it. See an example screenshot below.

<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="snapshots-and-clones"></a>Snapshots and Clones</h2>

An OpenEBS snapshot is a set of reference markers for data at a particular point in time. A snapshot acts as a detailed table of contents, with accessible copies of data that user can roll back to. Snapshots in OpenEBS are instantaneous and are managed through `kubectl`. More details about creating, cloning and deleting a snapshot is described [here](/v090/docs/next/operations.html#openebs-snapshots-and-clones).



</br>

<hr>

## Deleting volumes

<br>

When a PVC is deleted, the OpenEBS PV is deleted including the data in it. In StorageClass, the parameter `ReclaimPolicy` is set to `Delete` by default. If the data need to retain, it can be configured by changing `ReclaimPolicy` to `Retain` in the corresponding StorageClass or patching the corresponding PV is also possible. This is applicable only for Jiva volume. cStor currently does not support `Retain` feature.

## Upgrade considerations

<br>

More details about the upgrading of cStor volumes are mentioned in the Upgrade section. See [Upgrade](/v090/docs/next/upgrade.html) section for details.
