Review Process for Documentation Issues and Pull Requests
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  OpenEBS Lead receives documentation issues/pull requests raised by Documentation/Internal contributors.
2.  Lead will tag issues to relevant labels which start with the name **documentation** and assign reviewers and approvers such as feature owner, doc person, and approver.
3.  The assignee works on the issue either developing content in .md files or editing the content.
4.  The assignee can get the content from other collaborators of the OpenEBS project either as rst/md file or as a comment in the issue. The assignee can also use the "OpenEBS Slack" channel to collect
    additional information from the community.

    Documentation content is located under documentation/source in reStructured (rst) files. documentation/source/index.rst contains the high level documentation structure (Table of Contents), which links to the content provided in other rst files either in the same directory or in child directories.

    **Note:**

    Before editing the files, familiarize yourself with the reStructured markup.

5.  Once you are done with your edits and ready for review, you must create a PR see [Creating a Pull          Request](contribute/contribute_openebs_doc.html#creating-a-pull-request).
6.  The documents must be approved. see, [PR Approval Process](contribute/contribute_openebs_doc.html#pr-approval-process).
