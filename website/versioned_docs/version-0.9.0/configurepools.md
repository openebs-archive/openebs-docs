## Creating a new pool

Process of creating a new cStor storage pool

- Create a YAML spec `cstor-pool-config.yaml`. You can create a cStorPool in two ways.
  - [By specifying disks list](#manual-mode) (or)
  - [Without specifying disks list](#auto-mode) method
- Apply `cstor-pool-config.yaml` through `kubectl apply`  approach.

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="manual-mode"></a>Create a cStorPool by specifying diskList </h3>

**Step1:**

Create a YAML file called `cstor-pool1-config.yaml` with the following content. In the following YAML, `PoolResourceRequests` value is set to `2Gi` and `PoolResourceLimits` value is set to `4Gi`. This will be shared for all the volume replicas that resides on the pool. The value of these resources can be 2Gi to 4Gi per pool on a given node for a better performance. These values can be changed as per the Node configuration. 

```
#Use the following YAMLs to create a cStor Storage Pool.
# and associated storage class.
apiVersion: openebs.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoragePoolClaim
metadata:
  name: cstor-pool1
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: PoolResourceRequests
        value: |-
            memory: 2Gi
      - name: PoolResourceLimits
        value: |-
            memory: 4Gi
spec:
  name: cstor-pool1
  type: disk
  maxPools: 3
  poolSpec:
    poolType: striped
  # NOTE - Appropriate disks need to be fetched using `kubectl get disks`
  #
  # `Disk` is a custom resource supported by OpenEBS with `node-disk-manager`
  # as the disk operator
# Replace the following with actual disk CRs from your cluster `kubectl get disks`
# Uncomment the below lines after updating the actual disk names.

    diskList:
# Replace the following with actual disk CRs from your cluster from `kubectl get disks`

In the above file, change the parameters as required

- `poolType`

  This filed is not named very aptly. This field may be changed to `diskAggType` in future. This filed  represents how the data will be written to the disks on a given pool instance on a node. Supported values are `striped` or `mirrored`.

  Note: In OpenEBS, the pool instance do not extend beyond a node. The replication happens at volume level but not at pool level. See [volumes and pools relationship](/v090/docs/next/cstor.html#relationship-between-cstor-volumes-and-cstor-pools) in cStor for a deeper understanding.

- `maxPools`

  This value represents the maximum number cStorPool instances to be created. In other words if `maxPools` is `3`,  then three nodes are randomly chosen based on the disk name provided in `diskList` by OpenEBS and one cStorPool instance each will be created on them with provided disks. If even number of disks are available per Node and `poolType` as mirroed, then cStorPool instances will be created using mirrored manner. If many disks are added on each of the Node and chosen `poolType` as `striped` , the cStorPool instance will created using the mentioned disks on each Node.

  This value should be less than or equal to the total number of Nodes in the cluster.

- `diskList`

  Select the list of disk CRs in each participating nodes and enter them under `diskList`. To get the list of disk CRs use `kubectl get disks` . To know which node a given disk CR belongs, use `kubectl describe disk <disk-cr>`

  You must enter all the disk CRs manually together from the selected nodes. 

  When the `poolType` = `mirrored` make sure the disk CRs selected from each node are in even number.  The data is striped across mirrors. For example, if 4x1TB disks are selected on `node1`, the raw capacity of the pool instance of `cstor-pool1` on `node1` is 2TB. 

  When the `pooltype` = `striped` the number of disk CRs from each node can be in any number, the data is striped across each disk. For example, if 4x1TB disks are selected on `node1`, the raw capacity of the pool instance of `cstor-pool1` on that `node1` is 4TB. 

  The number of selected disk CRs across nodes need not be same. The disk CRs can be added to the pool spec dynamically as the used capacity gets filled up. 

  Note: Some of the pool expansion features of the cStorpools are under development. See [pool day2 operations](#day-2-operations-on-cstorpools)

- `type`

  This value can be either `sparse` or `disk`.  If you are creating a sparse pool using the sparse disks created as part of applying openebs operator YAML, then while configuring the `StoragePoolClaim`, choose type as `sparse`. For other disks, choose type as `disk`.

**Step2:**

After the pool YAML spec is created, run the following command to create the pool instances on nodes.

```
kubectl apply -f cstor-pool1-config.yaml
```

If the pool creation is successful, you will see the example result as shown below.

<div class="co">storagepoolclaim.openebs.io "cstor-pool1" created</div>

**Note:** The cStor pool can be horizontally scale up on new OpenEBS Node by editing  the corresponding pool configuration YAML with the new disks name under `diskList` and update the `maxPools` count accordingly. More details can be found [here](/v090/docs/next/operations.html#with-disklist).

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="auto-mode"></a>Create a cStorPool WITHOUT specifying diskList </h3>

Sometimes for new users, identifying the correct disks CRs and node-citizenship could be time consuming.  To make the process of cStorPool creation simple for users to quickly test cStor with real disks, OpenEBS supports creation of a cStorPool even when `diskList` is not specified in the YAML specification.  In this case, one pool instance on each node is created  with just one striped disk or one mirrored group of disks. 

Follow the below steps to create a quick cStorPool in this method.



**Step1:**

Create a YAML file called `cstor-pool-config2.yaml` with the following content.  In the following YAML, `PoolResourceRequests` value is set to `2Gi` and `PoolResourceLimits` value is set to `4Gi`. This will be shared for all the volume replicas that resides on the pool. The value of these resources can be 2Gi to 4Gi per pool on a given node for a better performance. These values can be changed as per the Node configuration.

## Pool Policies

This section captures the policies supported for cStorPools in `StoragePoolClaim` under `spec`  in the name and value pair format. 



<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="PoolResourceLimits-Policy"></a>PoolResourceLimits Policy</h3>

This feature allow you to set the limits on memory and cpu for pool pods. The resource and limit value should be in the same format as expected by Kubernetes. The `name` of SPC can be changed if you need.

```
apiVersion: openebs.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoragePoolClaim
metadata:
  name: cstor-disk
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: PoolResourceLimits
        value: |-
            memory: 4Gi
spec:
  name: cstor-disk
  type: disk
```





<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="PoolResourceRequests-Policy"></a>PoolResourceRequests Policy</h3>

This feature allow you to specify resource requests that need to be available before scheduling the containers. If not specified, the default values are used. The `name` of SPC can be changed if you need.

```
apiVersion: openebs.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoragePoolClaim
metadata:
  name: cstor-disk
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: PoolResourceRequests
        value: |-
            memory: 2Gi
spec:
  name: cstor-disk
  type: disk
```





<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="Tolerations"></a>Tolerations</h3>

cStor pool pods can be ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. This can be acheived using taint and tolerations method. If Nodes are tainted to schedule the pods which are tolerating the taint, then cStor pool pods also can be scheduled using this method.  Tolerations are applied to cStor pool pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

```
apiVersion: openebs.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoragePoolClaim
metadata:
  name: cstor-disk
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: Tolerations
        value: |-
          t1:
            effect: NoSchedule
            key: nodeA
            operator: Equal
          t2:
            effect: NoSchedule
            key: app
            operator: Equal
            value: storage
spec:
  name: cstor-disk
  type: disk
  maxPools: 3
  poolSpec:
    poolType: striped
```





<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="AuxResourceLimits-Policy"></a>AuxResourceLimits Policy</h3>

You can specify the *AuxResourceLimits* which allow you to set limits on side cars. 

```
apiVersion: openebs.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoragePoolClaim
metadata:
  name: cstor-disk
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name:  AuxResourceLimits
        value: |-
            memory: 0.5Gi
            cpu: 100m
    openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
```





<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="AuxResourceRequests-Policy"></a>AuxResourceRequests Policy</h3>

This feature is useful in cases where user has to specify minimum requests like ephemeral storage etc. to avoid erroneous eviction by K8s. `AuxResourceRequests` allow you to set requests on side cars. Requests have to be specified in the format expected by Kubernetes

```
apiVersion: openebs.io/v1alpha1
kind: StoragePoolClaim
metadata:
  name: cstor-disk
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: AuxResourceRequests
        value: |-
            memory: 0.5Gi
            cpu: 100m
    openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
```

## Day 2 operations on cStorPools

With latest release,only some day2 operations are supported. Many of day2 operations are under active development. See [cStor roadmap](/v090/docs/next/cstor.html#cstor-roadmap) for more details. 

**Note:** *All pools created using 0.8.1 will receive the pool expansion capabilities when those features are available in future releases.*

## Verifying pool status

<br>

Detailed metrics for cStorPool are under development. See [cStor Roadmap](/v090/docs/next/cstor.html#cstor-roadmap) for more details. 

At the moment, status of cStor pools is obtained via the standard `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands of pool  custom resources (spc, csp)

**StoragePoolClaim status**

```
 kubectl get spc
```

Following is an example output. 

<div class="co">NAME          AGE
cstor-pool2   1m
</div>


**cStorStoragePool status**

Once StoragePoolClaim is created, corresponding cStorStoragePool will be created. This can be check using the following command.

```
kubectl get csp
```

Following is an example output.

<div class="co">NAME               ALLOCATED   FREE      CAPACITY   STATUS    TYPE      AGE
cstor-pool2-ww4f   77K         39.7G     39.8G      Healthy   striped   53s
</div>


**cStorStoragePool pods status**

Once cStorStoragePool is created, corresponding pool pods will be created and running. This can be verified using the following command.

```
kubectl get pods -n openebs
```

Following is an example output. 

<div class="co">NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cstor-pool2-ww4f-74bc496f67-82m6z             3/3       Running   0          1m
maya-apiserver-6d9858ffc9-x6rlp               1/1       Running   0          4h
openebs-admission-server-56665784df-xwt8h     1/1       Running   0          4h
openebs-localpv-provisioner-94f6477bb-fwmnm   1/1       Running   0          4h
openebs-ndm-crz9z                             1/1       Running   0          4h
openebs-ndm-l7mbd                             1/1       Running   1          4h
openebs-ndm-nvlrg                             1/1       Running   0          4h
openebs-provisioner-5dbd679f8c-pqphv          1/1       Running   0          4h
openebs-snapshot-operator-66d89b9bcf-6dkj7    2/2       Running   0          4h
</div>

In the above example output, name starts with `cstor-pool2-\*` are the cStorStoragePool pods. It must be in running state to provision cStor Volumes.

**Note:** By default, OpenEBS cStorStoragePool pods will be running in `openebs` namespace.



cStor provides storage scalability along with ease of deployment and usage. cStor can handle multiple disks with different size per Node and create different storage pools. You can use these storage pools to create cStor volumes which you can utilize to run your stateful applications.

<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="monitoring-pool"></a>Monitor Pools</h2>

A new sidecar will run once a cStor pool pod is created.This sidecar will collect the metrics of the corresponding cStorStoragePool. Following metrics are supported by cStor to export the cStorStoragePool usage statistics as Prometheus metrics.

<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="sparse-pool-deepdive"></a>Sparse Pool Deep Dive</h2>

OpenEBS installation process creates the following defaults : 

- One sparse disk is created on each node in the cluster  once you enable the  `OPENEBS_IO_INSTALL_DEFAULT_CSTOR_SPARSE_POOL` ENV in the openebs operator YAML file before it is getting applied.
- After the previous step, a ready to use cStorPool config called `cstor-sparse-pool` will be created .  This `cstor-sparse-pool` config has a `cStorStoragePool` instance on every node of the cluster. 
- One StorageClass called `openebs-cstor-sparse` that points to `cstor-sparse-pool` will be created.
- This default StorageClass can be used for running application on cStorSparsePool.
