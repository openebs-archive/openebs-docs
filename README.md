# OpenEBS-docs

OpenEBS docs is the documentation repository for OpenEBS documentation. This is using Docusaurus as a documentation framework. It's easy to use and Madhuri (our Information Architect) would love to write documentation using Docusaurus, which uses markdown. 
More on the Docusaurus can be found here: https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html
