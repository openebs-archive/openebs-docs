| <br/><font size="5">1.3.0</font> | <br/> <font size="4">Latest Release</font><br/> (Recommended)<br/> <br/>[Release Notes](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/releases/tag/1.3.0)<br/> [Upgrade Steps](/docs/next/upgrade.html)<br/> | - Add support to scaleup replicas, replica movement across  pools and replica replacement scenarios. This feature is in alpha state. This feature will work for cStor volumes which are created with existing SPC configuration.<br>- Availability of NDM on different platforms like amd64 and arm64. NDM can now also be compiled in ARM architecture using manual steps.<br>- Added support for provisioning CSI based volume using lease leader election API.<br>- Support of running OpenEBS in Kubernetes 1.16 version. The k8s v1.16 release will stop serving the deprecated API versions in favour of newer and more stable API versions.<br>- Support the addition of resource limit to cStor pool pod using with CSPC configuration. `resource` field on CSPC is used to pass resource limit and requests to `cstor-pool` container and `auxResource` field on CSPC is used to pass `resource limit` and `requests` to other 2 containers such as `cstor-mgmt` and `m-exporter`.<br>- Enhanced backup capability of openebs-velero plugin by checking the status of `Healthy` cStor Volume Replica. In the previous version, a check was performed for healthy CVR during setup only. There might be some chances of cStor pod restart and CVR becomes degraded when we trigger the backup.<br/>- Enhanced CVC(cStor Volume Claim) CR by adding provisioning failure events while provisioning cStor volume using CSI provisioner. <br>- Fixed a bug where cStor volume becoming read-only due to restart of  cstor-volume-mgmt container alone in the target pod.<br>- Fixed wrong status on CVR from Duplicate to Online. Duplicate state on CVR was blocking reconcile on the volume creation in ephemeral case.<br>- Fixed a bug in cStor storage pool YAML. The livenessProbe command  `zfs set io.openebs:livenesstimestamp`  sets the value of io.openebs:livenesstimestamp to the current timestamp. In previous versions, this value was not set properly because of some shell quoting  issues in the command.<br>- Fixed a bug where Jiva volume running on CentOS 7 / RHEL in OpenShift cluster is going to read-only when the controller pod is restarted either due to node restart or upgrades or any other reason. This is due to iSCSI default timeout is replaced with 5 sec if multipath support is enabled on the node. |
| <br/>1.2.0                       | <br/>[Release Notes](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/releases/tag/1.2.0)<br/> [Upgrade Steps](/docs/next/upgrade.html)<br/> | - CSI Driver for cStor Volumes (currently in Alpha) has added support for resizing and volume expansion feature.<br>- The new version of cStor Schema has been introduced to address the user feedback in terms of ease of use for cStor provisioning as well as to make a way in the schema to perform Day 2 Operations using GitOps.<br>- Enhanced error logging of cStor storage pool with a new format for automatic alert generation.<br>- Enhanced Jiva internal snapshot deletion when a number of internal snapshots are more than 10. The deletion happens automatically one by one.<br>- Enhanced velero-plugin to support backup/restore for OpenEBS installed in a different namespace other than `openebs` namespace.<br>- Enhanced NDM to include NodeAttributes in BD and BDC. This will support storing of node name along with the hostname on the BD and BDC CRs.<br>- Fixes BlockDevice CRD by adding node name to the printer column. This feature will get the name of the node to which the BD is attached while performing `kubectl get bd -n <openebs_installed_namespace>`.<br>- Fixes a bug in Jiva when patching and clean up operation of Jiva deployments are failing on Nodes where `hostname` is not the same as `nodename`. The fix will set nodeSelector in deployment and clean-up job after converting the nodename into hostname.<br>- Support of provisioning Local PV in clusters where `nodename` and `hostname` are different.<br>- Support customization of default hostpath for Jiva and Local PV. With the current implementation, customization will not persisted when a restart happened on the Node where maya-apiserver pod is running or when maya-apiserver pod is restarted.<br>- Fixes a bug in NDM where all devices on a node were getting excluded when os-disk-exclude-filter is failed to find the device where OS is installed.<br>- Fixes a bug in snapshot controller where snapshot operation is not throwing any error for invalid `cas-type`. This fix will add `cas-type` validation before triggering the snapshot operations. The valid `cas-type` are cStor and Jiva.<br>- Fixes the bug where more than required BlockDevicesClaims are created for requested SPC in auto pool method.<br>- Fixes an issue in maya-api installer to skip re-apply of default SPC and SC resources if they were installed previously by older version(s) of maya or prior to mayaapi-server restart(s) <br>- Fixes a bug in cStor pool when cStor Storage Pool management creates pool if pool import failed when a disk is not accessible momentarily just at the time of import. cStor storage pool will be in the pending state when this scenario occurs. This PR will fix cStor pool creation by looking on `Status.Phase` as `Init` or `PoolCreationFailed` to create the pool. If `Status.Phase` is any other string, cStor Storage Pool management will try to import the pool. This can cause impact to the current workflow of Ephemeral disks, which works as of now, as NDM can't detect it as different disk and recognizes as the previous disk.<br>- Fixes a bug during a cleanup operation performed on BlockDevice and clean up job is not getting canceled when the state of BlockDevice is changed from `Active` to other states. <br>- Fixes a bug in NDM where cleanup jobs remain in pending state in Openshift cluster. The fix will add service account to cleanup jobs, so that clean-up job pods acquire privileged access to perform the action. |
| <br/>1.1.0                       | <br>[Release Notes](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/releases/tag/1.1.0)<br/> [Upgrade Steps](/docs/next/upgrade.html)<br/> | - Support for an alpha version of CSI driver with limited functionality for provisioning and de-provisioning of cStor volumes.<br/>- Support for the upgrade of OpenEBS storage pools and volumes through Kubernetes Job. As a user, you no longer have to download scripts to upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1, like in earlier releases.<br/>- Enhanced Prometheus metrics exported by Jiva for identifying whether an iSCSI Initiator is connected to Jiva target.<br/>- Enhanced NDM operator capabilities for handling NDM CRDs installation and upgrade. Earlier this process was handled through maya-apiserver. <br/>- Enhanced velero-plugin to take backup based on the `openebs.io/cas-type:cstor` and it will skip backup for unsupported volumes(or storage providers).<br/>- Enhanced velero-plugin to allow users to specify a `backupPathPrefix` for storing the volume snapshots in a custom location. This allows users to save/backup configuration and volume snapshot data under the same location.<br/>- Added an ENV flag which can be used to disable default config creation. The default storage configuration can be modified after installation, but it is going to be overwritten by the OpenEBS API Server.The recommended approach for customizing is to create their own storage configuration using the default options as examples/guidance.<br>- Fixes an issue where rebuilding cStor volume replica failed if the cStor volume capacity was changed after the initial provisioning of the cStor volume.<br/>- Fixes an issue with cStor snapshot taken during transition of replica's rebuild status.<br>- Fixes an issue where application file system was breaking due to the deletion of Jiva auto-generated snapshots.<br>- Fixes an issue where NDM pod was getting restarted while probing for details from the devices that had write cache supported.<br/>- Fixes an issue in NDM where Seachest probe was holding open file descriptors to LVM devices and LVM devices were unable to detach from the Node due to NDM hold on device.<br/>- Fixes a bug where backup was failing where `openebs operator` was installed through helm. `velero-plugin` was checking `maya-apiserver` name and it was different when you have installed via helm based method. Updated velero-plugin to check label of maya-apiserver service name.<br> |
