Running OpenEBS on a Multi-Node CentOS 7 OpenShift Cluster
==========================================================

This section provides detailed instructions on how to setup a multi-node Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYO) OpenShift cluster on CentOS 7 and run applications on it with OpenEBS storage.

Prerequisites
---------------

-   At least 2 or more CentOS 7 hosts (virtual-machines/baremetal/cloud instances) with 2 vCPUs, 4G RAM and 16GB hard disk.
-   Ensure that the following package dependencies are installed on the hosts using yum install. **Note:** You may need to update yum prior to this step.
    -   python, wget, git, net-tools, bind-utils, iptables-services, bridge-utils, bash-completion, kexec-tools, sos, psacct, docker-1.12.6, iscsi-initiator-utils
-   Ensure that the following python packages are installed on hosts using pip install. **Note:** Python-pip can be installed using easy\_install pip if not present already.
    -   Ansible (\>= 2.3) on the local machine or any one of the hosts (typically installed on the host used as openshift-master).
    -   pyYaml Python package on all the hosts.
-   Functional DNS server, with all hosts configured by appropriate domain names (ensure nslookup of the hostnames is successful in resolving the machine's IP addresses).
-   Setup passwordless SSH between the Ansible host and other hosts.

**Notes:**

-   System recommendations for production cluster can be found here. This document focuses on bringing up a setup for evaluation purposes.
-   Ensure that the Docker service is running.

Installing OpenShift
--------------------

1. Download the OpenShift Ansible Playbooks.

Clone the OpenShift Ansible repository of any stable release branch to your Ansible machine and go to the directory. Use the same version of openshift-ansible and openshift-origin release for installation.

In this example, you will install Openshift Origin release v3.7 using the following commands. 

```
git clone
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git cd openshift-ansible
```

2.  Prepare the OpenShift Inventory file.

Create the ansible inventory file to install a simple OpenShift cluster with only master and nodes setup. You can use the following inventory template. 

```
cat openshift\_inventory
[OSEv3:children] masters nodes etcd
[OSEv3:vars] \# SSH user, this user should allow ssh based auth
without requiring a password ansible_ssh_user=root
ansible\_ssh\_port=22 openshift\_deployment\_type=origin
deployment\_type=origin openshift\_release=v3.7
openshift_pkg_version=-3.7.0 debug_level=2openshift_disable_check=disk_availability,memory_availability,docker_storage,docker_image_availability
openshift_master_default_subdomain=apps.cbqa.in
osm_default_node_selector='region=lab'

openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth','login': 'true','challenge':'true', 'kind':'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename':
'/etc/origin/htpasswd'}]

[masters] CentOS1.cbqa.in
[etcd] CentOS1.cbqa.in

[nodes] 
CentOS1.cbqa.in openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra','zone': 'baremetal'}" openshift_schedulable=true 
CentOS2.cbqa.in openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'lab', 'zone': 'baremetal'}"
openshift_schedulable=true 
CentOS3.cbqa.in openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'lab', 'zone': 'baremetal'}"
openshift_schedulable=true 
CentOS4.cbqa.in openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'lab', 'zone': 'baremetal'}"
openshift_schedulable=true
```

**Note:** The OpenShift deploy cluster playbook performs a health-check prior to execution of the install roles to verify system readiness.

Typically, the following pitfalls can be observed:

-   Memory\_availability and storage\_availability
    -   Issue: Checks fail if you do not adhere to production standards.
    -   Workaround: Disable check by adding into openshift\_disable\_check inventory variable.
-   Docker image availability
    -   Issue: Checks fail if there are DNS issues/flaky networks due to which the docker.io registry cannot be accessed. Sometimes, this fails even when a manual inspection shows they are available and
        accessible to the machine.
    -   Workaround: If manual Skopeo inspect is successful, disable check by adding into openshift\_disable\_check inventory variable.

        Skopeo inspect example: skopeo inspect --tls-verify=false docker://docker.io/cockpit/kubernetes:latest

-   Docker storage availability
    -   Issue: Can fail if the Docker service is not running. The daemon does not automatically run post yum install.
    -   Workaround: Restart Docker daemon.
-   Package availability and Package version
    -   Issue: OpenShift packages with desired versions (specified in the inventory) are not available for install with default repository setup.

    -   Workaround: The OpenShift Origin packages are released separately for CentOS. The repositories on these need to be added into the hosts.

        The packages are available here and the GPG keys can be downloaded from here.

        Following additions can be made to the existing CentOS repositories (/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo): 

        ```
        #Openshift
        [openshift] name=CentOS-OpenShift
        baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/paas/x86\_64/openshift-origin/
        gpgcheck=1 enabled=1
        gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-SIG-PaaS
        ```

3.  Run the Ansible Playbook job to setup OpenShift cluster.

Once the inventory file is ready, run the deploy\_cluster playbook to setup the OpenShift cluster. The setup can take around 15-20 minutes depending on network speed and resources available.

**Note:** The deploy\_cluster playbook also includes playbooks to setup Glusterfs, monitoring, logging and so on which are optional. In this example, only the etcd, master, node, and management setup
playbooks were executed, with other playbook imports commented. 

```
ansible-playbook -i openshift-ansible/openshift\_inventory openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy\_cluster.yml
```

The playbook should complete without errors. The trailing output of the playbook run should look similar to the following: 

```
PLAY RECAP*********************************
CentOS1.cbqa.in : ok=404 changed=124 unreachable=0 failed=0
CentOS2.cbqa.in : ok=144 changed=46 unreachable=0 failed=0
CentOS3.cbqa.in : ok=144 changed=46 unreachable=0 failed=0
CentOS4.cbqa.in : ok=144 changed=46 unreachable=0 failed=0 localhost :

Master Install :Complete (0:09:44) 
Master Additional Install : Complete (0:00:48)

```

Execute the following commands to verify successful installation. 

```
oc get nodes
NAME STATUS AGE VERSION centos1.cbqa.in Ready 16h v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62
centos2.cbqa.in Ready 16h v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62 centos3.cbqa.in Ready
16h v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62 centos4.cbqa.in Ready 16h v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62
```

4.  Initial setup

- Execute the following command to create a new administrator user with cluster-admin role/permissions which can be used to run the OpenEBS operator and deploy applications.

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin --as=system:admin
```

- Assign password to the administrator user using the following command.

```
htpasswd /etc/origin/htpasswd admin
```

- Login as administrator user and use the "default" project (administrator is logged into this project by default).

```
oc login -u admin
```

- Provide access to the host-volumes (which are needed by the OpenEBS volume replicas) by updating the default security context (scc) using the following command.

```
oc edit scc restricted
```

Add **allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true** and save changes.

Alternatively, you can use the following command.

```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostaccess admin --as:system:admin
```

-   Allow the containers in the project to run as root using the following command.

    ```
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default --as=system:admin
    ```

**Note:** While the above procedures may be sufficient to enable host access to the containers, it may also be needed to disable selinux (using setenforce 0) to ensure the same.

5.  Setup OpenEBS Control Plane

Download the latest OpenEBS operator files and sample application specifications on the OpenShift-Master machine using the following commands. 

```
git clone <https://github.com/openebs/openebs.git> 
cd openebs/k8s
```

Apply the openebs-operator on the OpenShift cluster using the following commands. 

```
oc apply -f openebs-operator 
oc apply -f openebs-storageclasses.yaml
```

Verify that the OpenEBS operator services are created successfully and deployments are running using the following commands. Also, check whether the storageclasses are created successfully. 

```
oc get deployments

```

6. Deploy a sample application with OpenEBS storage.

- Use OpenEBS as persistent storage for a percona deployment by selecting the openebs-percona storageclass in the persistent volume claim. A sample is available in the openebs git repo (which was cloned in the previous steps).


Apply the following percona deployment yaml using the following commands. 

```
cd demo/percona 
oc apply -f demo-percona-mysql-pvc.yaml
```

Verify that the deployment runs successfully using the following commands.

```
oc get pods

NAME                                                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
