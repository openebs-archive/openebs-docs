<br><br>

Director Online agents are installed in a namespace called `maya-system`. These agents primarily include 

- Prometheus client that collects metrics from OpenEBS volumes and export them to Director Online.
- Topology client that queries Kubernetes resources and send the status when requested.
- Fluentd aggregators that export the logs to Director Online.

User's data is never looked into or exported to Director Online by the agents. 

**Note**: Director Online administrators will have read-only access to the topology, metrics and logs that are exported to Director Online.
