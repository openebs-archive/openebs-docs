<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="What-is-most-distinctive-about-the-OpenEBS-architecture?"></a>What is most distinctive about the OpenEBS architecture?</h3>
The OpenEBS architecture is an example of Container Attached Storage (CAS). These approaches containerize the storage controller, called IO controllers, and underlying storage targets, called “replicas”, allowing an orchestrator such as Kubernetes to automate the management of storage. Benefits include automation of management, a delegation of responsibility to developer teams, and the granularity of the storage policies which in turn can improve performance.

<a href="#top">Go to top</a>

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="Why-did-you-choose-iSCSI"></a>Why did you choose iSCSI? Does it introduce latency and decrease performance?</h3>
We at OpenEBS strive to make OpenEBS simple to use using Kubernetes as much as possible to manage OpenEBS itself. iSCSI allows you to be more resilient in cases where the workload and the controller are not on the same host. In other words, the OpenEBS user or architect will not suffer an outage when the storage IO controller is not scheduled locally to the workload in need of storage. OpenEBS does a variety of things to improve performance elsewhere in the stack. More is to come via the cStor storage engine in order to have this level of flexibility.

<a href="#top">Go to top</a>

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="where-is-my-data"></a>Where is my data stored and how can I see that?</h3>
OpenEBS stores data in a configurable number of replicas. These are placed to maximize resiliency. For example, they are placed in different racks or availability zones.

To determine exactly where your data is physically stored, you can run the following kubectl commands.

- Run `kubectl get pvc` to fetch the volume name. The volume name looks like: *pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be*.

- For each volume, you will notice one IO controller pod and one or more replicas (as per the storage class configuration). For the above PVC, run the following command to get the IO controller and replica pods. 

  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be
  ```

  The output displays the following pods.

  ```
  IO Controller: pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-ctrl-6798475d8c-7dcqd
  Replica 1: pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-rep-86f8b8c758-hls6s     
  Replica 2: pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-rep-86f8b8c758-tr28f  
  ```

- To check the location where the data is stored, get the details of the replica pod. For getting the details of Replica 1 above, use the `kubectl get pod -o yaml pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be-rep-86f8b8c758-hls6s` command. Check the volumes section.

  ```
  volumes:
    	   - hostPath:
      	   path: /var/openebs/pvc-ee171da3-07d5-11e8-a5be-42010a8001be
         	   type: ""
         - name: openebs
  ```

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="changes-on-k8s-for-openebs"></a>What changes are needed for Kubernetes or other subsystems to leverage OpenEBS?</h3>
One of the major differences of OpenEBS versus other similar approaches is that no changes are required to run OpenEBS on Kubernetes. However, OpenEBS itself is a workload and the easy management of it is crucial especially as the Container Attached Storage (CAS) approach entails putting containers that are IO controller and replica controllers.

You can access the OpenEBS IO controller via iSCSI, exposed as a service. The nodes require iSCSI initiator to be installed. In case the kubelet is running in a container for example, as in the case of Rancher and so on, the iSCSI initiator should be installed within the kubelet container.

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="get-started"></a>How do you get started and what is the typical trial deployment?</h3>
If you have a Kubernetes environment, you can deploy OpenEBS using the following command.

`kubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml`

You can then begin running a workload against OpenEBS. There is a large and growing number of workload that have storage classes that use OpenEBS. You need not use these specific storage classes. However, they may be helpful as they save time and allow for per workload customization.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="default-reclaim-policy"></a>What is the default OpenEBS Reclaim policy?</h3>
The default retention is the same used by K8s. For dynamically provisioned PersistentVolumes, the default reclaim policy is “Delete”. This means that a dynamically provisioned volume is automatically deleted when a user deletes the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim. 

In case of cStor volumes, data was being deleted as well. 

For jiva, from 0.8.0 version, the data is deleted via scrub jobs. The completed job can be deleted using `kubectl delete job <job_name> -n <namespace>`

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="why-ndm-priviledged"></a>Why NDM Daemon set required privileged mode?</h3>
Currently, NDM Daemon set runs in the privileged mode. NDM requires privileged mode because it requires access to `/dev` and `/sys` directories for monitoring the devices attached and also to fetch the details of the attached device using various probes.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="OpenEBS-install-prerequisites-openshift-centos"></a>What are the prerequisites other than general prerequisites for installing OpenEBS in Centos and OpenShift?</h3>
If you are installing OpenEBS in CentOS or OpenShift,you must need to grant privileges to ndm pods. For installing OpenEBS in OpenShift environment,more details can be read [here](/docs/next/kb.html#OpenEBS-install-openshift-without-SELinux-disabled).

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="verify-cstor-volume-running-fine"></a>How to verify cStor volume is running fine?</h3>
The following steps will help to verify the cStor volume running status.

1. Check PVC is created successfully using the following command.

   ```
   kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>
   ```

2. If PVC is created successfully, check corresponding PV is also created successfully.

   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```

3. Check the corresponding target pod of the cStor volume is running using the following command. 

   ```
   kubectl get pod -n openebs 
   ```

   The target pod should be in running state.

4. Now check the status of cStor volume using the following command.

   ```
   kubectl get cstorvolume -n openebs
   ```

   The output of above command will show status as `Offline`, `Degraded` and `Healthy`. Following are the definition for each of these status.

   **Offline:** Replicas may not able to connect to its target pod due to network issues. In this case, IOs will not happen on this cStor volume. 

   **Degraded:** All replicas of the cStor volume are not in Healthy state, corresponding volume will be running as degraded. In this case, IOs can happen on this volume. Please refer next step for more details about CVR status.

   **Healthy:**  All replicas of the cStor volume are in Healthy state.

   Note: If target pod of corresponding cStor volume is not running, then the status of cStor volume shown in the output of above command may be stale.

5. Check the cStorVolumeReplica(CVR) status of the corresponding cStor volume using the following command.

   ```
   kubectl get cvr -n openebs
   ```

   The output of above command will show status as `Offline`, `Degraded`, `Rebuilding` and `Healthy`. Following are the definition for each of these status.

   **Offline:** Replica is not connected to the target pod.

   **Degraded:** Replica of the cStor volume need to get synced from other replica of the corresponding volume. 

   **Rebuilding:** Replica is in rebuilding state to sync up the data from other replicas of the corresponding volume.

   **Healthy:** Replica is having full data.

   Note: If pool pod corresponding to cStor volume replica is not running, then the status of CVR shown in the output of above command may be stale.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="how-is-data-protected-what-happens-when-a-host-client-workload-or-a-data-center-fails"></a>How is data protected? What happens when a host, client workload, or a data center fails?</h3>
Kubernetes provides many ways to enable resilience. OpenEBS leverages these wherever possible.  For example, say the IO container that has the iSCSI target fails. Well, it is spun back up by Kubernetes. The same applies to the underlying replica containers, where the data is actually stored. They are spun back up by Kubernetes. Now, the point of replicas is to ensure that when one or more of these replicas are being respun and then repopulated in the background by OpenEBS, the client applications still run.  OpenEBS takes a simple approach to ensuring that multiple replicas can be accessed by an IO controller using a configurable quorum or the minimum number of replica requirements. In addition, our new cStor checks for silent data corruption and in some cases can fix it in the background.  Silent data corruption, unfortunately, can occur from poorly engineered hardware and from other underlying conditions including those that your cloud provider is unlikely to report or identify.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="how-does-openebs-provide-high-availability-for-stateful-workloads"></a>How does OpenEBS provide high availability for stateful workloads?</h3>
An OpenEBS Jiva volume is a controller deployed during OpenEBS installation. Volume replicas are defined by the parameter that you set. The controller is an iSCSI target while the replicas play the role of a disk. The controller exposes the iSCSI target while the actual data is written. The controller and each replica run inside a dedicated container. An OpenEBS Jiva volume controller exists as a single instance, but there can be multiple instances of OpenEBS Jiva volume replicas. Persistent data is synchronized between replicas. OpenEBS Jiva volume high availability is based on various scenarios as explained in the following sections. 

**Note:** Each replica is scheduled in a unique K8s node, and a K8s node never has two replicas of one OpenEBS volume.

- **What happens when an OpenEBS volume controller pod crashes?**

  Kubernetes automatically re-schedules the controller as a new Kubernetes pod. Policies are in place that ensures faster rescheduling.

- **What happens when a K8s node that hosts OpenEBS volume controller goes offline?**

  The controller is automatically re-scheduled as a new Kubernetes pod. Policies are in place that ensures faster rescheduling. If the Kubernetes node is unavailable, the controller gets scheduled on one of the available nodes.

- **What happens when an OpenEBS volume replica pod crashes?** 

  The replica is automatically rescheduled as a new Kubernetes pod when an OpenEBS volume replica pod crashes for reasons other than node not-ready and node unreachable. The replica may or may not be rescheduled on the same K8s node. There is data loss with this newly scheduled replica if it gets rescheduled on a different K8s node.

- **What happens when a K8s node that hosts OpenEBS volume replica goes offline?**

  There is no storage downtime as the other available replica displays inputs/outputs. Policies are in place that does not allow rescheduling of crashed replica (as the replica is tied to a node’s resources) on any other node.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="what-are-the-recommended-iscsi-timeout-settings-on-the-host"></a>What are the recommended iscsi timeout settings on the host?</h3>
There are cases when application pod and OpenEBS cStor target pod are running on different nodes. In such cases, there may be chances that application can go to read only when K8s takes around 5 mins to re-schedule OpenEBS target pod to a new Node. To avoid such scenarios,default iscsi timeout values can be configured to the recommended one. 

<h4><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="configure-iscsi-timeout"></a>Configure the iscsi timeout value</h4>
The following explains the configuration change for 2 different scenarios.

1. For New iSCSI sessions
2. For those sessions already logged in to iSCSI target.



**For New iSCSI sessions**:

Do below configuration settings on the host node to change the default iscsi timeout value.

1. Edit iscsid.conf file.

2. Modify **node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout** with 300 seconds.

   

**For those sessions already logged in to iSCSI target:**

Below command can be used to change the setting for logged in sessions:

```
iscsiadm -m node -T <target> -p ip:port -o update -n node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout -v 300
```



<h4><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="verify-iscsi-timeout"></a>Verify the iscsi timeout settings </h4>
Verify the configured value by running “iscsiadm -m session -P 3”  and check "Recovery Timeout" value under "Timeouts". It should be configured as 300.

You may notice the change in the “Attached scsi disk” value. This causes volume to get unmounted and thus volume need to be remounted. Detailed steps for remounting volume are mentioned [here](https://blog.openebs.io/keeping-openebs-volumes-in-rw-state-during-node-down-scenarios-f2b54df94a32).

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="what-changes-must-be-made-to-the-containers-on-which-openebs-runs"></a>What changes must be made to the containers on which OpenEBS runs?</h3>
OpenEBS has been engineered so that it does not require any changes to the containers on which it runs. Similarly, Kubernetes itself does not require to be altered and no additional external orchestrator is required. However, the workloads that need storage must be running on hosts that have iSCSI initiators, which is a default configuration in almost all operating systems.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="what-are-the-minimum-requirements-and-supported-container-orchestrators"></a>What are the minimum requirements and supported container orchestrators?</h3>
OpenEBS is currently tightly integrated into Kubernetes. Support for Docker Swarm is something OpenEBS is looking at in future releases.

The system requirements depend on the number of volumes being provisioned and can horizontally scale with the number of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. The OpenEBS control plane comprises of minimum two pods i.e. apiserver and dynamic provisioner. You can run these using 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs.

Each volume will spin up IO controller and replica pods. Each of these will require 1GB RAM and 0.5 CPU by default.

For enabling high availability, OpenEBS recommends having a minimum of 3 nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="why-would-you-use-openebs-on-ebs"></a>Why would you use OpenEBS on EBS?</h3>
There are at least four common reasons for running OpenEBS on Amazon EBS that are listed as follows:

Attach / Detach: The attach / detach process can slow the environment operations dependent on EBS.

No volume management needed: OpenEBS removes the need for volume management, enabling the combination of multiple underlying EBS volumes without the user needing to run LVM or other volume manager. This saves time and reduces operational complexity.

Expansion and inclusion of NVMe: OpenEBS allows users to add additional capacity without experiencing downtime. This online addition of capacity can include NVMe and SSD instances from cloud providers or deployed in physical servers. This means that as performance requirements increase, or decrease, you can use Kubernetes via storage policies to instruct OpenEBS to change capacity accordingly.

Other enterprise capabilities: OpenEBS adds other capabilities such as extremely efficient snapshots and clones as well as forthcoming capabilities such as encryption. Snapshots and clones facilitate much more efficient CI/CD workflows as zero space copies of databases and other stateful workloads can be used in these and other workflows, improving these without incurring additional storage space or administrative effort. The snapshot capabilities can also be used for replication. As of February 2018 these replication capabilities are under development.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="what-must-be-the-disk-mount-status-on-node-for-provisioning-openebs-volume"></a>What must be the disk mount status on Node for provisioning OpenEBS volume?</h3>
OpenEBS have two storage Engines, Jiva and cStor which can be used to provision volume. 

Jiva requires the disk to be mounted (i.e., attached, formatted with a filesystem and mounted). 

cStor can consume disks that are attached (are visible to OS as SCSI devices) to the Nodes which does not have any filesystem and it should be unmounted on the Node. It is good to wipe out the disk if you use existing disks for cStor pool creation. 

In case you need to use Local SSDs as block devices, you will have to first unmount them and remove any the filesystem if it has. On GKE, the Local SSDs are formatted with ext4 and mounted under "/mnt/disks/". If local SSDs are not unmounted and not removed the file system, then cStor pool creation will fail.

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="how-openebs-detects-disks-for-creating-cstor-pool"></a>How OpenEBS detects disks for creating cStor Pool?</h3>
Any block disks available on the node (that can be listed with say `lsblk`) will be discovered by OpenEBS. 
Node Disk Manager(NDM) forms the DISK CRs in the following way

- Scan the list of disks.
- Filter out the OS disks
- Filter out partitioned disks.
- Filter out any other disk patterns that are mentioned in `openebs-ndm-config` under `Configmap` in `openebs-operator.yaml`.

NDM do some filtering on the disks to exclude, for example boot disk. By default, NDM excludes the following device path to create disk CR. This configuration is added in `openebs-ndm-config` under `Configmap` in `openebs-operator.yaml`.

```
/dev/loop - loop devices.
/dev/fd - file descriptors.
/dev/sr - CD-ROM devices.
/dev/ram - ramdisks.
/dev/dm -lvm.
/dev/md -multiple device ( software RAID devices).
```

It is also possible to customize by adding more disk types associated with your nodes. For example, used disks, unwanted disks and so on. This change must be done in the 'openebs-operator.yaml' file that you have downloaded before OpenEBS installation.

**Example:**

```
  filterconfigs:
    - key: path-filter
      name: path filter
      state: true
      include: ""
      exclude: "loop,/dev/fd0,/dev/sr0,/dev/ram,/dev/dm-,/dev/md"
```

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="provision-pvc-higher-than-physical-sapce"></a> Can I provision OpenEBS volume if the request in PVC is more than the available physical capacity of the pools in the Storage Nodes?</h3>
As of 0.8.0, the user is allowed to create PVCs that cross the available capacity of the pools in the Nodes. In the future release, it will validate with an option `overProvisioning=false`, the PVC request should be denied if there is not enough available capacity to provision the volume.

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="what-is-the-difference-between-cstor-pool-creation-using-manual-method-and-auto-method"></a>What is the difference between cStor Pool creation using manual method and auto method?</h3>
By using manual method, you must give the selected disk name which is listed by NDM. This details has to be entered in the StoragePoolClaim YAML under `diskList`. See [storage pool](/docs/next/ugcstor.html#creating-cStor-storage-pools) for more info. 
It is also possible to change `maxPools` count and `poolType` in the StoragePoolClaim YAML. 
Consider you have 4 nodes with 2 disks each. You can select `maxPools` count as 3, then cStor pool will create in any 3 nodes out of 4. The remaining disks belongs to 4th Node can be used for horizontal scale up in future.
Advantage is that there is no restriction in the number of disks for the creation of cStor storage pool using `striped` or `mirrored` Type.

By auto method, its not need to provide the disk details in the StoragePoolClaim YAML. You have to specify `maxPools` count to limit the storage pool creation in OpenEBS cluster and `poolType` for the type of storage pool such as Mirrored or Striped.

But the following are the limitations with this approach.

1. For Striped pool, it will take only one disk per Node even Node have multiple disks.
2. For Mirrored pool, it will take only 2 disks attached per Node even Node have multiple disks.

Consider you have 4 nodes with 4 disks each. If you set `maxPools` as 3 and `poolType` as `striped`, then Striped pool will created with Single disk on 3 Nodes out of 4 Nodes.
If you set `maxPools` as 3 and `poolType` as `mirrored`, then Mirrored cStor pool will create with single Mirrored pool with 2 disks on 3 Nodes out of 4 Nodes.

If `maxPool` count is 3 in StoragePoolClaim, then 3 cStor storage pool will create if it meet the required number of Nodes,say 3 in this example.
If `replicaCount` is 2 in StorageClass, then 2 OpenEBS volume will create on the top of any 2 cStor storage pool out of 3.

<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="create-cstor-volume-single-disk-pool"></a>How to create a cStor volume on single cStor disk pool?</h3>
You can give the maxPools count as 1 in StoragePoolClaim YAML and `replicaCount` as `1`in StorageClass YAML. In the following sample SPC and SC YAML, cStor pool is created using auto method. After applying this YAML, one cStor pool named cstor-disk will be created only in one Node and `StorageClass` named `openebs-cstor-disk`. Only requirement is that one node has at least one disk attached but unmounted. See [here](docs/next/faq.html#what-must-be-the-disk-mount-status-on-node-for-provisioning-openebs-volume) to understand more about disk mount status.
