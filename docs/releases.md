| <br/><font size="5">1.1.0</font> | <br/> <font size="4">Latest Release</font><br/> (Recommended)<br/> [Release Notes](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/releases/tag/1.1.0)<br/> [Upgrade Steps](v110/docs/next/upgrade.html)<br/> | - Support for an alpha version of CSI driver with limited functionality for provisioning and de-provisioning of cStor volumes.<br/>- Support for the upgrade of OpenEBS storage pools and volumes through Kubernetes Job. As a user, you no longer have to download scripts to upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1, like in earlier releases.<br/>- Enhanced Prometheus metrics exported by Jiva for identifying whether an iSCSI Initiator is connected to Jiva target.<br/>- Enhanced NDM operator capabilities for handling NDM CRDs installation and upgrade. Earlier this process was handled through maya-apiserver. <br/>- Enhanced velero-plugin to take backup based on the `openebs.io/cas-type:cstor` and it will skip backup for unsupported volumes(or storage providers).<br/>- Enhanced velero-plugin to allow users to specify a `backupPathPrefix` for storing the volume snapshots in a custom location. This allows users to save/backup configuration and volume snapshot data under the same location.<br/>- Added an ENV flag which can be used to disable default config creation. The default storage configuration can be modified after installation, but it is going to be overwritten by the OpenEBS API Server.The recommended approach for customizing is to create their own storage configuration using the default options as examples/guidance.<br>- Fixes an issue where rebuilding cStor volume replica failed if the cStor volume capacity was changed after the initial provisioning of the cStor volume.<br/>- Fixes an issue with cStor snapshot taken during transition of replica's rebuild status.<br>- Fixes an issue where application file system was breaking due to the deletion of Jiva auto-generated snapshots.<br>- Fixes an issue where NDM pod was getting restarted while probing for details from the devices that had write cache supported.<br/>- Fixes an issue in NDM where Seachest probe was holding open file descriptors to LVM devices and LVM devices were unable to detach from the Node due to NDM hold on device.<br/>- Fixes a bug where backup was failing where `openebs operator` was installed through helm. `velero-plugin` was checking `maya-apiserver` name and it was different when you have installed via helm based method. Updated velero-plugin to check label of maya-apiserver service name.<br> |
