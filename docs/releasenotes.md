OpenEBS Release Version 0.5.1
-----------------------------

### Issues Fixed in v0.5.1

* Fixed the inter-operability issues of connecting to OpenEBS Volume from CentOS iscsi Initiator [1087](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/1087).


* Fixed openebs-k8s-provisioner that must be launched in non-default namespace [1055](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/#1055).
* Update the documentation with steps to use OpenEBS on OpenShift Kubernetes Cluster [1102](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/1102) and Kubernetes on CentOS [1104](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/1104).
* Update helm charts to use OpenEBS 0.5.1 [1100](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/#1100)

### Known Limitations 

-   Requires Kubernetes 1.7.5+
-   Requires iscsi initiator that must be installed in the Kubernetes nodes or kubelet container
-   Not recommended for mission critical workloads
-   Not recommended for performance sensitive workloads. Efforts are ongoing to improve performance.

### Installation

Execute the following command to install OpenEBS using kubectl.

````
kubectl apply -f <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/v0.5.1/k8s/openebs-operator.yaml
````

Execute the following command to install OpenEBS using helm. 

```
helm repo add openebs-charts https://openebs.github.io/charts/ 
helm repo update 
helm install openebs-charts/openebs
```

### Images

-   *openebs/jiva:0.5.1* : Containerized Storage Controller
-   *openebs/m-apiserver:0.5.1* : OpenEBS Maya API Server along with the latest maya cli.
-   *openebs/openebs-k8s-provisioner:0.5.1* : Dynamic OpenEBS Volume Provisioner for Kubernetes.
-   *openebs/m-exporter:0.5.1* : OpenEBS Volume metrics exporter.

### Setup OpenEBS Volume Monitoring

If you are running your own Prometheus, please update it with the
following job configuration: 

```
- job_name: 'openebs-volumes' 
  scheme: http 
  kubernetes_sd_configs: 
  - role: pod 
  relabel_configs: 
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_monitoring] 
    regex:volume_exporter_prometheus 
    action: keep 
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name] 
    action: replace 
    target_label: kubernetes_pod_name 
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_vsm] 
    action: replace 
    target_label: openebs_pv 
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number] 
    action: drop 
    regex: '(.*)9501' 
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number] 
    action: drop 
    regex: '(.*)3260

```

If you do not have Prometheus running, you can use the following yaml file to run Prometheus and Grafana. 

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/v0.5.0/k8s/openebs-monitoring-pg.yaml
```

You can import the following grafana-dashboard file to view the OpenEBS Volume metrics.

### Notes for Contributors

-   openebs/mayaserver has been deprecated and code migrated to openebs/maya (openebs/maya \#95)
-   openebs/maya repository now hosts all the OpenEBS native control plane components like m-apiserver, mayactl, m-exporter. The build and directory structures are accordingly modified. Please see
    openebs/maya/cmd/\<component-name\> for a starting point.
-   openebs/maya now uses GO as a build tool and dep for dependency management (openebs/maya \#96 )
-   CLI is moving toward COBRA. All the new components use COBRA, mayactl except for the volume stats command, while others now support COBRA CLI. In the next release, we look forward to move the
    remaining commands to COBRA CLI and converge on a single CLI framework. (openebs/maya \#388)
-   The OpenEBS control plane components are designed to be plugged into different COs. The components/framework is being refactored to make it easy to support additional COs in the future release. Some of these framework changes are warranting to remove the code dependent on the deprecated usage (primarily used by nomad) is being removed.
-   openebs/maya/cmd/maya-agent was introduced to manage and automate the local storage functionality. This component is being renamed to openebs/maya/cmd/maya-nodebot and is primarily intended to augment the functionality already provided by k8s local storage manager and
    node-exporter (openebs/openebs \#194)

### Limitations

-   Running in Azure K8s Clusters (not verified)

OpenEBS Release Version 0.4.0

### Issues Fixed in v0.4.0

-   \#166 (<https://github.com/edorid>): openebs-k8s-provisioner goes into crashloopbackoff, during the first volume creation
-   \#176 (<https://github.com/maikotz>): OpenEBS PV is unreachable after one of the replica becomes unreachable.

### Known Issues in v0.4.0

-   \#633 (<https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/633>):

**Issue:**

Setting up OpenEBS with Kubernetes using Minikube on the Ubuntu host displayed the following error. *error: error validating "openebs-operator.yaml": error validating data: unknown object type schema.GroupVersionKind{Group:"", Version:"v1", Kind:"ServiceAccount"}; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false*

**Resolution**

1.  Download a specific/compatible version, by replacing the **$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt>)** portion of the command with a specific version.

    For example, to download v1.8.0 on Linux, enter the following command. 

    ```
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl>
    ```

2.  Make the kubectl binary executable. 

    ```
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    ```

3.  Move the binary in to your PATH.  

    ```
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```

    ​

### CI Updates with v0.4.0

-   Support for on-premise Jenkins CI for performing e2e tests
-   iSCSI compliance tests are run as part of the CI
-   CI can now be extended using a framework developer for running storage benchmark tests with vdbench or fio.
-   CI has been extended to run Percona Benchmarking tests on Kubernetes.

### Deprecated with v0.4.0

The maya cli options (setup-omm, setup-osh, omm-status, osh-status) to setup and manage dedicated OpenEBS setup is removed. Starting with v0.4.0, only hyperconvergence with Kubernetes is supported.

### Notes for Contributors

-   OpenEBS user documentation is currently being moved into *openebs/openebs/documentation*
-   OpenEBS developer documentation is currently being added to *openebs/openebs/contribute*
-   The deployment and e2e functionality will continue to be located in *openebs/k8s* and *openebs/e2e* respectively.
-   openebs/maya will act as a single repository for hosting different OpenEBS Storage Control plane (orchestration) components.
-   New /metrics handlers are being added to OpenEBS components to allow integration into tools like Prometheus.
-   *openebs/maya/cmd/maya-agent* which will be deployed as a deamon-set running along-side kubelet is being developed. maya-agent will augument the kubelet with storage management functionality.
