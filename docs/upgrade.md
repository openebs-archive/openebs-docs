OpenEBS has deprecated arch specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. After 2.6, the arch specific images are not pushed to Docker or Quay repositories. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:2.8.0` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:2.8.0`.
