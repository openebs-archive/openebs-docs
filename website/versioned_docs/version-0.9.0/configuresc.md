## Creating a new StorageClass

<br>

StorageClass definition is an important task in the planning and execution of OpenEBS storage. As detailed in the CAS page, the real power of CAS architecture is to give an independent or a dedicated storage engine like cStor for each workload, so that granular policies can be applied to that storage engine to tune the behaviour or performance as per the workload's need. In OpenEBS policies to the storage engine (in this case it is cStor) through the `annotations` specified in the `StorageClass` interface. 

<font size="5">Steps to create a cStor StorageClass</font>

**Step1:** Decide the cStorPool

**Step2:** Which application uses it? Decide the replicaCount based on it.

**Step3:** Are there any other storage policies to be applied to the StorageClass? Refer to the [storage policies section](#cstor-storage-policies) for more details on the storage policies applicable for cStor.

**Step4:** Create a YAML spec file <storage-class-name.yaml> from the master template below, update the pool, replica count and other policies and create the class using `kubectl apply -f <storage-class-name.yaml>` command.

**Step5:** Verify the newly created StorageClass using `kubectl describe sc <storage-class-name>`



<font size="5">Example Configuration of OpenEBS StorageClass</font>

You can create a new StorageClass YAML called **openebs-sc-rep1.yaml** and add content to it from below. The following will create a StorageClass of OpenEBS volume replica of `1`, Storage Pool as `cstor-pool2` and CAS type as `cstor`.

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-sparse-sc-statefulset
  annotations:
    openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: StoragePoolClaim
        value: "cstor-pool2"
      - name: ReplicaCount
        value: "1"
provisioner: openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
```

    openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
```

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="Target-Affinity-Policy"></a>Target Affinity Policy</h3>

The StatefulSet workloads access the OpenEBS storage volume  by connecting to the Volume Target Pod. This policy can be used to co-locate volume target pod on the same node as workload.

The configuration for implementing this policy is different for deployment and StatefulSet applications.

<h4><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="for-statefulset-applications"></a>For StatefulSet Applications</h4>

In the case of provisioning StatfulSet applications with replication factor of  greater than "1" and volume replication factor of euqal to "1", for a given OpenEBS volume, target and replica related to that volume should be scheduled on the same node where the application resides. This feature can be achieved by using either of the following approaches.

**Approach 1:**

In this approach, modification is required on StatefulSet spec and corresponding StorageClass being referred in the StatefulSet spec. Add openebs.io/sts-target-affinity: <metadata.name of STS> label in StatefulSet spec to the following fields.

- spec.selector.matchLabels  
- spec.template.labels

**Example snippet:**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
name: test-application
labels:
  app: test-application
spec:
serviceName: test-application
replicas: 1
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: test-application
    openebs.io/sts-target-affinity: test-application
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: test-application
      openebs.io/sts-target-affinity: test-application
```

Do the following changes in the StorageClass that is referred by the claimTemplates of this StatefulSet.

- Set volumeBindingMode to WaitForFirstConsumer

**Example snippet:**

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: cstor-sts
annotations:
  openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
  cas.openebs.io/config: |
    - name: ReplicaCount
      value: "1"
    - name: StoragePoolClaim
      value: "cstor-sparse-pool" 
provisioner: openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

**Approach 2:**

This approach is useful when user/tool does not have control over the StatefulSet spec. in this case, it requires a new StorageClass per StatefulSet application.

Add following changes in the StorageClass that is referred to by the claimTemplates of this StatefulSet.

- Add openebs.io/sts-target-affinity: <metadata.name of STS> label to the following fields.
  - metadata.labels
- Set volumeBindingMode to WaitForFirstConsumer

**Example snippet:**

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: cstor-sts
labels:
  openebs.io/sts-target-affinity: test-application # name of StatefulSet application
annotations:
  openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
  cas.openebs.io/config: |
    - name: ReplicaCount
      value: "1"
    - name: StoragePoolClaim
      value: "cstor-sparse-pool" 
provisioner: openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

**Note:** It is recommended to do application pod stickiness for seamless working of the above approaches. Example YAML spec for STS can be get from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/12be2bbdb244d50c8c0fd48b59d520f86aa3a4a6/k8s/demo/mongodb/demo-mongo-cstor-taa.yaml).

<h4><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="for-deployment-applications"></a>For Deployment Applications</h4>

This feature makes use of the Kubernetes Pod Affinity feature that is dependent on the Pod labels. User will need to add the following label to both Application and PVC.

```
labels:
  openebs.io/target-affinity: <application-unique-label>
```

You can specify the Target Affinity in both application and OpenEBS PVC using the following way For Application Pod, it will be similar to the following.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fio-cstor
  labels:
    name: fio-cstor
    openebs.io/target-affinity: fio-cstor
```

The following is the sample snippet of the PVC to use Target affinity.

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: fio-cstor-claim
  labels:
    openebs.io/target-affinity: fio-cstor
```

**Note**: This feature works only for cases where there is a 1-1 mapping between a application and PVC. 

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="Target-Namespace"></a>Target Namespace</h3>

By default, the cStor target pods are scheduled in a dedicated *openebs* namespace. The target pod also is provided with OpenEBS service account so that it can access the Kubernetes Custom Resource called `CStorVolume` and `Events`.
This policy, allows the Cluster administrator to specify if the Volume Target pods should be deployed in the namespace of the workloads itself. This can help with setting the limits on the resources on the target pods, based on the namespace in which they are deployed.
To use this policy, the Cluster administrator could either use the existing OpenEBS service account or create a new service account with limited access and provide it in the StorageClass as follows:

```
annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: PVCServiceAccountName
        value: "user-service-account"  
```

The sample service account can be found [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/k8s/ci/maya/volume/cstor/service-account.yaml).

<h3><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="cStorStoragePool-Anti-Affinity"></a>cStorStoragePool Replica Anti-Affinity</h3>

This policy will adds the ability in cStor to correlate and hence distribute single replica volumes across pools which are in turn deployed in separate nodes when application consuming all these volumes is deployed as a StatefulSet.  

Below are supported anti-affinity features:

- `openebs.io/replica-anti-affinity: <unique_identification_of_app_in_cluster>`
- `openebs.io/preferred-replica-anti-affinity: <unique_identification_of_app_in_cluster>`

Below is an example of a statefulset YAML spec that makes use of `openebs.io/replica-anti-affinity`:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    cas.openebs.io/config: |

##  Performance Tunings


Allow users to set available performance tunings in StorageClass based on their workload. Below are the tunings that are required:

- cStor target queue depth
  - This limits the ongoing IO count from client. Default is 32.
- cStor target worker threads
  - Sets the **number of threads** that are working on above queue. It is mentioned by `Luworkers`.Default value is 6.
- cStor volume replica worker threads
  - This Is associated with cStorVolumeReplica.
  - It is mentioned by `ZvolWorkers`.
  - Defaults to the number of cores on the machine.

**Note:**  These configuration can be only used during volume provisioning. Default values will be used in case of "Invalid/None" values has been provided using configuration.

**Example Configuration:**

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: openebs-cstor-pool
annotations:
  openebs.io/cas-type: cstor
  cas.openebs.io/config: |
    - name: StoragePoolClaim
      value: "sparse-claim-auto"
    - name: QueueDepth
      value: "20"
    - name: Luworkers
      value: "10"
    - name: ZvolWorkers
      value: "4"
provisioner: openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
```

**Note:** For sequential workload, setting `luworkers` to 1 is good. For random workload,  default setting to 6 is good.
